of the games they've played or the games they own. The website is customizable
to the user's preference.

### Technologies Used

### How to Run

2. The user can search through the database by entering an ID, keyword,
or genre to filter results
3. Only when a single result is displayed can the user choose to edit or delete
the Game from the database
4. The user is notified of the status of a deletion, or if filtering through the
database, the user will see a list of results
